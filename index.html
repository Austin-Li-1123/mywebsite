            <p>Born in November 1998 in Huzhou, China, I spent 8 years in Huzhou with my family. After graduating from kindergarten, my family moved to Shanghai, China, which is one of the biggest and most cosmopolitan cities in the country. I spent 8 years - elementary school, middle school, junior high, and high school - in Shanghai; I consider it as my second hometown. Graduating from an American-invested high school, I came all the way from China to the U.S. for further education. Now I have spent half a year in the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign and have just started my fabulous college life. This website will be updated regularly with all the exciting new stuffs I will be doing in the future. Fell free to contact me! All my contact information is at the bottom of this page.  :)</p>

            <p>Impressed by Aziza Chaouni’s effort to bring her city back through uncovering the Fez River, I, for years, put efforts into environmental campaigns. However, the more I devote into the cause, the stronger I felt that even if we have thousands of people working together, the power is not enough. It will be more effective to convince people because environmental contamination is such prevalent issue that it cannot be fixed by a single team or organizations. In 2015, I attended IB World Student Conference at the University of Rochester. There I convinced my teammates that although we didn’t have enough power, at least we could try to make people aware of the issue by our fresh ideas. We combined the theme of the conference, “play”, and the idea of environmental protection and designed a game called Junk Dunk Challenge to encourage garbage recycling. We shot a video that guide audiences and show them our dunks; we pinned our hopes on the Facebook users. Evoking our friends to help share the video, we eventually got hundreds of people knowing about us and liking us; some even produced their own episodes to show their junk dunks.<br>Despite the key role I played in the project, the greatest treasure I gained was the ability to think critically and creatively. Sometimes, as I am not able to achieve my goals directly, I can draw on creativity and probably I will gain surprising and outstanding results.</p>

            <p>For an original 3<em>3 Rubik’s Cube, there are 42 quintillion possibilities, each of which is a secret story of the player. Practicing the Rubik’s Cube did not occupy much of my time, but it was a part of me. Most people hold a certain understanding of Rubik’s Cube that higher recovery speed is the biggest pursuit of the players. But, I would say the most important thing the game can give the player is a good understanding of the space variation and the capacity of being a multi-tasker.<br>When I was 9 years old, the first time I saw my classmate play the Rubik’s cube I was attracted by the amazing changes and indistinct rules. I bought myself the first Rubik’s cube and began to explore it. By memorizing formulas and techniques, I reached a level that beginners cannot reach in a short period of time. I dabbled in different Rubik’s Cubes, like 4</em>4 Rubik’s Cube, 5*5 Rubik’s Cube and those of various special-shaped. I appreciate to learn and solve the Rubik’s Cubes one by one like passing through checkpoints.<br>One day, I took a wrong recovering step that turned to reach the effect of another formula, which made me confused but curious. I quickly wrote down the new formula, and wondered why two different methods got the same results. Unfortunately, after one-week hard work, I did not have any clue. A Rubik’s Cube has myriads of changes, and even a step will make completely different results, not to mention the comparison of two different formulas. I was upset, why can’t I find the secret?<br>To uncover the secret, I study the Rubik’s cube instead of memorizing formulas. Having reviewed the previous learnt formulas again and again, I found out inside spatial thinking in each block movement. I repeatedly tried formulas day and night, putting every move and change in my mind. After a few steps, each block can reach the intended position, but the movement order was chaotic. Although each rotation was for a layer, each block seemed to be in their duties. Thinking in multiple ways at the same time often made me headache so that I could not take it anymore. Gradually, I observed more blocks at the same time from the beginning of 2 to the maximum of 6. I fully understood the formula one by one, catching the meaning of every step and change. After that, I forgot all formulas and created my own special method. Having understood the connection between each square and axis, experienced the different block changes of every rotation, I can picture each move in my mind. I think, to some extent, it was my new rule of the Rubik’s cube. Meanwhile, it was the new rule that enlightened me that rules established by predecessors are destined to be broken by descendant. No absolute rules exist, and changes may create things.<br>Having acquired the philosophy from the Rubik’s cube, I created a Rubik’s cube club in my high school, aiming at conveying my understanding to others. This was a difficult process, but I also got the best return. I often was inspired by other members to gain fresh ideas and different views. More importantly, I provided more people with opportunities to break rules some of which may be set by me and create new rules according to their understanding.</p>

            <p>Now I already graduated from high school. Yet, surprisingly every time I look back to the past 2 years, the images that pop out most frequently in my mind are all associated with the Rubik’s Cube Clue I found at school.<br>As the student with the most outstanding Rubik’s Cube skills and experience, I founded a club where members can share their valuable experience and techniques. Along with other hand movement club including pen spinning, flying cup, our group became the big society named Spark. In order to raise the students’ enthusiasm for Rubik’s Cube, I shared my experience with Rubik’s learners and beginners. I spent around 1 hour every week to teach each members. I held the first Rubik’s competition with my friends and participated in the competition. I won the Champion and kept the school’s record for Rubik’s cube. In general, I was the forerunner who has initiated the atmosphere of Rubik’s cube in my high school. As Rubik’s cube is an extremely helpful activity which can improve players’ spatial thinking ability and mathematics skills, it was the way I made my high school a better place.</p>

            <p>Learning IB economics in  high school, I was fascinated and read books and lectures about the balance of trade and self-correction mechanism. However, there was always one thing that confuses me: Sometimes I found the knowledge and theories in economics are easy to grasp because they have something in common. However, I could never tell the invisible link among them although I sometimes could catch a glimpse of it.<br>This summer holiday, I was offered to get involved in a discussion-based seminar in economics and business administration. After that, I had a new understanding of economics and it gave me the answer which I have sought for years. Our instructor, a professor who got his PHD in Johns Hopkins University lectured on the philosophy of economics: how to achieve maximum profit out of minimum cost. Although this sounds simple and rudimental, it is truly the underlying relationship that makes all the economic transactions and decisions make sense. Indeed, for consumers, producers, and governments, although they do care about other aspects of their stakes, essentially, it is the balance of gain and pay.<br>What’s more, besides removing my bewilderment, the seminar was constructive for one more reason. Instead of teaching us further economics models and knowledge, he inspired us to find the philosophy of economics in our life. With the broader definition of profit and cost, we found the surprising truth that every time we make a decision we are considering this trade off. There is really a lesson for life: Minimum Cost to Maximum Profit, which sounds so easy and understandable but I had never realized. The course brought me a profound understanding of every piece of knowledge I had learned in economics. The new understanding of economics leads to a great curiosity and interest in the field.</p>
