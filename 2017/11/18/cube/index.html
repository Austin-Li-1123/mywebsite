        <p>For an original 3<em>3 Rubik’s Cube, there are 42 quintillion possibilities, each of which is a secret story of the player. Practicing the Rubik’s Cube did not occupy much of my time, but it was a part of me. Most people hold a certain understanding of Rubik’s Cube that higher recovery speed is the biggest pursuit of the players. But, I would say the most important thing the game can give the player is a good understanding of the space variation and the capacity of being a multi-tasker.<br>When I was 9 years old, the first time I saw my classmate play the Rubik’s cube I was attracted by the amazing changes and indistinct rules. I bought myself the first Rubik’s cube and began to explore it. By memorizing formulas and techniques, I reached a level that beginners cannot reach in a short period of time. I dabbled in different Rubik’s Cubes, like 4</em>4 Rubik’s Cube, 5*5 Rubik’s Cube and those of various special-shaped. I appreciate to learn and solve the Rubik’s Cubes one by one like passing through checkpoints.<br>One day, I took a wrong recovering step that turned to reach the effect of another formula, which made me confused but curious. I quickly wrote down the new formula, and wondered why two different methods got the same results. Unfortunately, after one-week hard work, I did not have any clue. A Rubik’s Cube has myriads of changes, and even a step will make completely different results, not to mention the comparison of two different formulas. I was upset, why can’t I find the secret?<br>To uncover the secret, I study the Rubik’s cube instead of memorizing formulas. Having reviewed the previous learnt formulas again and again, I found out inside spatial thinking in each block movement. I repeatedly tried formulas day and night, putting every move and change in my mind. After a few steps, each block can reach the intended position, but the movement order was chaotic. Although each rotation was for a layer, each block seemed to be in their duties. Thinking in multiple ways at the same time often made me headache so that I could not take it anymore. Gradually, I observed more blocks at the same time from the beginning of 2 to the maximum of 6. I fully understood the formula one by one, catching the meaning of every step and change. After that, I forgot all formulas and created my own special method. Having understood the connection between each square and axis, experienced the different block changes of every rotation, I can picture each move in my mind. I think, to some extent, it was my new rule of the Rubik’s cube. Meanwhile, it was the new rule that enlightened me that rules established by predecessors are destined to be broken by descendant. No absolute rules exist, and changes may create things.<br>Having acquired the philosophy from the Rubik’s cube, I created a Rubik’s cube club in my high school, aiming at conveying my understanding to others. This was a difficult process, but I also got the best return. I often was inspired by other members to gain fresh ideas and different views. More importantly, I provided more people with opportunities to break rules some of which may be set by me and create new rules according to their understanding.</p>
